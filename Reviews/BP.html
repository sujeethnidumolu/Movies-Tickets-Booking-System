    <header> <h1 class="exp">Here is my review for the movie BLACK PANTHER <br> 4.5 </h1> </header>
   <div class="proj">
	                                                           <h1>STORY</h1>			                              
<div>Chittibabu, a pure and innocent guy with partial deafness, earns his livelihood by supplying water to agricultural lands in the fictional village of Rangasthalam , set in 1980's rural India. The crux of the story forms when his brother decides to contest against the President who rules the village since 30 years by usurping the lands of innocent villagers. Chittibabu has to go for any means to let his brother win the election contest.</div>
                                                               <h1>ACTING</h1>
 <div>Jagapathi Babu(President) is excels in his role,terrifically portrayed.He can just act with his eyes.Experience matters a lot to pull of such an act. Adi pinisetty (Kumar Babu) ,Prakash Raj(Dakshina Murthy),Anasuya(Rangamatha) are so apt for their role, they added lot of value to the story line. Every character in the movie has their importance , no character is just standing there as a prop.</div>
                                                              <h1>DIRECTION</h1>
<div>This is Sukumar’s first village subject. He has made sure that all the characters are different and characterization is original. Having an hearing impaired character as lead role and making it lovable is a tough task and Sukumar makes sure that there is consistency in characterization.</div>
	                                                             <h1>MUSIC</h1>
<diV>Music and background score are just the soul of the movie (DSP can just break his own records)</diV>
                                                                 <h1>SCREENPLAY</h1>
<div> Action sequences are choreographed well in a realistic manner though some of the fights are lengthy. Dialogues are pretty good. Art direction is excellent and it takes us to 80’s. Editing by Naveen Nooli is fine. </div>
