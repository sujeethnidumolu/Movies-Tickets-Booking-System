	<div>Chittibabu, a pure and innocent guy with partial deafness, earns his livelihood by supplying water to agricultural lands </div>
                                                               <h2>Acting</h2>
	<div>Jagapathi Babu(President) is excels in his role,terrifically portrayed.He can just act with his eyes</div>
                                                               <h2>Direction</h2>
	<div>This is Sukumarâ€™s first village subject. He has made sure that all the characters are different and characterization is original. Having an hearing impaired character as lead role and making it lovable is a tough task and Sukumar makes sure that there is consistency in characterization.</div>

	<div>Music and background score are just the soul of the movie (DSP can just break his own records)</div>
                                                                <h2>Screenplay</h2>
	<div> Action sequences are choreographed well in a realistic manner though some of the fights are lengthy </div>
